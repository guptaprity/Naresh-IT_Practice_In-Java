# Book Equality Check 📚

## 📌 Problem Statement
Create a program in Java to compare two books using `equals()` and `hashCode()`.  
Two books are considered equal if both their `title` and `author` are the same.

## 🛠️ Implementation
- `Book` class has two fields: `title` and `author`.  
- Overrides:
  - `equals(Object obj)` → compares title and author.
  - `hashCode()` → generates hash code based on title and author.  
- In `MainApp2`, user input is taken for two books and equality is checked.

## 📥 Input Format
1. Title of first book (single word, use `next()`)  
2. Author of first book (single word, use `next()`)

4. Author of second book (single word, use `next()`)

## 📤 Output Format
- First line: `"Books are equal"` OR `"Books are not equal"`.  
- Second line: `"Book1 HashCode: <number>"`  
- Third line: `"Book2 HashCode: <number>"`

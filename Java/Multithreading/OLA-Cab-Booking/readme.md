# üöñ Multithreading Based OLA Cab Booking Process
## üéØ Objective
This program demonstrates **Multithreading in Java** through a real-world simulation of an **OLA cab booking process**.  
Each stage of the ride ‚Äî from requesting a cab to rating the driver ‚Äî is implemented as a separate **Thread** class.

## üß© Classes Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `RideRequest`
**Purpose:** Simulates the user‚Äôs ride request and driver search.

**Thread Behavior:**
- Prints `"User requested a ride..."`
- Waits for **2 seconds**
- Prints `"Searching for nearby drivers..."`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `DriverAssignment`
**Purpose:** Handles driver assignment after a search.

**Thread Behavior:**
- Waits for **3 seconds**
- Prints `"Driver found and assigned!"`

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `FareCalculation`
**Purpose:** Calculates the estimated ride fare.

**Thread Behavior:**
- Prints `"Calculating estimated fare..."`
- Waits for **1.5 seconds**
- Prints `"Estimated fare: 135.75 RS."`

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `LiveTracking`
**Purpose:** Simulates live tracking of the cab ride.

**Thread Behavior:**
- Prints ride progress in **20% increments**:
Updating ride location... 20% completed
Updating ride location... 40% completed
Updating ride location... 60% completed
Updating ride location... 80% completed
Updating ride location... 100% completed

markdown
Copy code
- Finally prints `"Ride completed!"`

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `PaymentProcessing`
**Purpose:** Handles payment after ride completion.

**Thread Behavior:**
- Prints `"Processing payment..."`
- Waits for **2 seconds**
- Prints `"Payment successful!"`

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ `RatingSystem`
**Purpose:** Collects user feedback.

**Thread Behavior:**
- Prints `"Requesting user rating..."`
- Waits for **1 second**
- Prints `"User rated the ride: 5 star"`

---

## üß† Execution Logic (in `OlaRidingApp` main class)

### Step-by-step Flow:
1. Create objects for all six classes (`RideRequest`, `DriverAssignment`, `FareCalculation`, `LiveTracking`, `PaymentProcessing`, `RatingSystem`).
2. Start **RideRequest** and **FareCalculation** threads together.
3. Use `join()` on the **RideRequest** thread ‚Äî ensuring the next steps wait until ride request completes.
4. Then, start the following threads **sequentially** using `start()` and `join()`:
 - `DriverAssignment`
 - `LiveTracking`
 - `PaymentProcessing`
 - `RatingSystem`

## üßæ Expected Output

```text
User requested a ride...
Calculating estimated fare...
Estimated fare: 135.75 RS.
Searching for nearby drivers...
Driver found and assigned!
Updating ride location... 20% completed
Updating ride location... 40% completed
Updating ride location... 60% completed
Updating ride location... 80% completed
Updating ride location... 100% completed
Ride completed!
Processing payment...
Payment successful!
Requesting user rating...
User rated the ride: 5 star
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts Demonstrated
Multithreading using Thread class

start() and run() method overriding

Thread synchronization using join()

Simulated real-world workflow using concurrency

## üèÅ Summary
This scenario-based Java program provides a realistic simulation of an OLA cab booking system using multithreading.
Each stage runs as an independent thread, ensuring parallel execution, controlled synchronization, and realistic timing behavior ‚Äî perfectly showcasing how threads can coordinate complex tasks efficiently.
